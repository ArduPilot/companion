Testing regime for new image:
-----------------------------
# make sure (USB?) ethernet is unplugged!

# Check if AP exists

# Connect to AP

# ssh into device
ssh apsync@10.0.1.128

# Check "screen -list" includes mavlink-router, DataFlashLogger, cherrypy:
screen -list

screen -list
There are screens on:
	1754.cherrypy	(12/08/2017 03:00:54 AM)	(Detached)
	1733.DataFlashLogger	(12/08/2017 03:00:54 AM)	(Detached)
	1704.mavlink-router	(12/08/2017 03:00:54 AM)	(Detached)

# Check APWeb is running:
sudo screen -list
There is a screen on:
	1765.apweb	(12/08/2017 03:00:54 AM)	(Detached)

# ensure mavproxy starts on the apsync image:
mavproxy.py --master :14550 --source-system=56
# make sure you can fetch parameters:
param fetch
param status

# Can you connect using a GCS using the broadcast packets on port 14550?
# on host machine:
mavproxy.py --mav10 --master :14550 --source-system=89
# make sure you can fetch parameters:
param fetch

# ensure you can connect multiple GCS at the same time!

# make sure LOG_BACKEND_TYPE is 2
# make sure dflogger is creating dataflash logs:
# arm the vehicle *and turn the safety off*, then:
watch "ls dflogger/dataflash -lt | head"


# can you connect to to the AP using a mobile phone and/or tablet?

# BEFORE testing the following, disable internet access on the phone!
# Test Each of Tower on Android, QGC on Android, QGC on Linux, MP on Windows:
 # can you connect to the vehicle?
 # can you control the vehicle?
 Test UDP port 5600 streaming works to:
  QGC on Linux
  QGC on Android
  Tower on Android (need to change setting!)
  Mission Planner on Windows

# Video Streaming testing:
 Use a web browser to connect on port 8000; make sure start/stop work


# web interface testing
# ! ENSURE NO GCS IS RUNNING BEFORE DOING THESE INTERFACE TESTS !
# this testing script must be run through for:
#   firefox
#   chromium-browser
#   edge
